TODO:
```
	!!! show the user which incorrect letters have been already used
	lock the game when someone is playing it
	maybe add config option in the menu  to specify total retry attempts limit etc
	remove duplicated "if OR" for the auto completer
	add and test the  grpc connection timeout and command timeout
	unit/integration tests
	api versioning in grpc ?
	maybe use terminal package to draw the hangman and menus - https://github.com/gizak/termui
	vendor all dependancies
```
